# PAYSTATION TTD
> 


This is a functional testing to make sure each fucntion does exactly what it's meant to do without malfunctioning.

## Usage example

Java Development using Netbean 8.2 IDE

## Running
```sh
Open Netbeans 8.2 -> Click Run tab -> Click Run Test File
```
## Goal
```sh
Edit, compile and run JUnit Java code without a Main function.
Practice test driven development.

```

## Development setup


```sh
  Let NetBeans "resolve" projects problems with JUnit to automatically add hamcrest binary to the project.
If you are having problems with JUnit in NetBeans, make sure you are using NetBeans 8.2 and not NetBeans 8.0.2. 
On MacOS if the interface and menu of NetBeans 8.2 are not working make sure you are not using a version of Java more recent than:

## Requirements

The purpose of this project was to modify the PayStation project
using TDD (test-driven development). There were a total of 8 extra test
cases that had to be added. We needed to commit to the repository every time
a test was added and when a test passed. Every commit needed to include a
commit message.

Everything was implemented according to the project's requirements. 
The test cases were added and all of the new test cases passed the tests.
We committed to the repository every time a test case was added and 
every time a test case passed a test. TDD was the main focus of this
assignment and we made sure to utilize it to the best of our abilities
during the testing process. 

No additional improvements beyond the assignment's requirements were made on our behalf. 
We knew that we were working on learning the basics of TDD with this lab so we only
completed what was required in order to remain within the boundaries of the lab.
We implemented TDD as much as we could and this lab really helped us understand 
test-driven development. 

## Team

Saad Khan: Firstly, I updated the methods in PayStationImpl.java and added instructions to them.
Then, I created, added, and tested about half of the new test cases in PayStationImplTest.java. 
Lastly, I updated README.md and added the Requirements section.
